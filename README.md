A first general overview of the project.

#### What is it about❓

More and more people are working from home.
With the pandemic, this trend has accelerated again.
As employees usually think it's great because of their gain in flexibility, many companies are still concerned about productivity.

I want to remove this contradiction and show the following:

##### Satisfied employees ➕ increased quality of their work

#### What should be the outcome? 💡

A website that shows employees and companies whether home office means happier employees and increased work quality. Both sides should also have the opportunity to fill out surveys and thus continue to expand the database.

#### What will this help with? 🎯

For employees: possibly confirm their arguments for working from home
For Businesses: possibly eliminate their productivity concerns

#### How do we get that? 🔍

By proving a correlation between satisfied employees and increased work quality when working from home. Also, by showing other advantages as a result of the survey (if there are any).

#### Where does the data come from? 💾

From my own observations (100 employee survey) and publicly available company surveys (side benefits).

#### Which techniques are used? ⚙️

Own online survey, data preparation (Python/Pandas), SQL database (AWS), backend (Python, otherwise NodeJS), frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap)
