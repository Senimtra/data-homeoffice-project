## What is it about❓

More and more people are working from home.

In many areas of work, this has led to happier employees, and more and more companies are now relying on this form of work and offering it, at least part-time.

But few companies still have doubts and fear a negative impact on productivity.

I want to show that this fear is unfounded and that companies benefit from remote work...

### from happier ➕ more productive employees.🫡<br><br>

## What should be the outcome? 💡

An app that continuously collects and processes data from employees, examining the effect of remote work on satisfaction/productivity and any side effects.

* For employees: greater satisfaction
* For Businesses: increased productivity<br><br>

## What will this help with? 🎯

* For employees: possibly confirm their arguments for working from home
* For Businesses: possibly eliminate their productivity concerns<br><br>

## How do we get that? 🔍

* By proving a correlation between satisfied employees and increased work quality when working from home.
* Also, by showing other advantages as a result of the survey (if there are any).<br><br>

## Where does the data come from? 💾

* From my own observations (100 employee survey)
* Continuous data collection through a survey in the app<br><br>

## Which techniques are used? ⚙️

* Online survey (Google forms)
* Data preparation (Python/Pandas)
* SQL database (AWS)
